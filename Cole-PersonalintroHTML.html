    I am a student in the Cybersecurity degree program. I really do enjoy
    coding because it is fun 
    creating what you want and seeing it come together. In my free time, I spend time tinkering with my 
    electronics around the house, play video games occasionally and root for my favorite teams, the Carolina 
    Hurricanes and the Carolina Tar Heels.
